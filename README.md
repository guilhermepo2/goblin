# Goblin Game Engine ![Goblin](gbln.png)

1. built with gueepo2D
2. Resource Manager
3. ECS
4. LUA
5. Editor
   1. The editor should be able to create/edit/save/load maps, and tilemaps
   2. The editor should be able to create/edit/save/load entities
   3. The editor should be able to create/edit/save/load scenes
   4. The editor should be able to create/edit/save/load resources

The end goal is to be able to create an entire game without coding C++, but if I can and think it's a good idea to do C++ while making a game with The Goblin Game Engine, then cool.
